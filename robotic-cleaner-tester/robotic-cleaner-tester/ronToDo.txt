-this project version doesn't include FilesLister, FileListersWithSUffix, and
the main function i wrote in robotic-cleaner-tester.cpp  with try, catch. 

0. change algo names to my id

1. important changes in moodle:
http://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/page/view.php?id=375915

1. add: if validHouses ==0, then print usage

1. unite with FilesListers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. in SingletonHouseIOMangaer in function ValidateWallsAndCharacters Tuval replaced all
illegal characters with space.  Not sure if that's what we need. Asked in forum.


1. one guy said he installed eclipse and got errors. i get errors in log.  also 
try to search eclipse crashes

1. work in windows (without dl).  finish all printings.  then transfer to linux.
then think whether to add FilesLister...   I will probably need to add 
FilesLister etc for Houses.  It seems Tuval has already implemented it for the
algorithm case.
